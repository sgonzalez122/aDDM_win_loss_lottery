* In the other half of the trials participants choose between LOSS trials: each associated  with a probability p of loosing $10 and a probability 1-p of $0

## Outline of task events
1. Administer informed consent
2. Written task instructions
3. 16 practice trials (no eye-tracking, they don't count for payment): 8 in WIN frame and 8 in LOSS frame.
4. Eye-tracking calibration
5. Block of 200 trials
6. Eye-tracking re-calibration
7. Block of 200 trials
8. Random selection of trials that count for payoff and payment

## Task description
* Subjects perform 400 trials of the task, divided into two 200 trial blocksw: one for wins and one for losses, with order counterbalanced across subjects
* Each trial the probability of each WIN or LOSS shown on the screen is selected independently from p = 45%, 46%, ...., 55%
* The stimuli are then assembled as 2 circles each with 100 balls inside. p of them are colored in RED for LOSS trials and GREEN for WIN trials, and 1-p of them are colored WHITE. The location of the balls within the circle is randomized for each stimulus. 
* At the end of the experiment the participant picks a number labelled 1-200 from an urn and the lottery chosen in that trial in both the WIN and LOSS trials is played. (This is done by preparing an urn with the right number of balls and randomly choosing one for each case). 
* Participants are paid a $40 show-up fee + whatever they earn/loose from the randomly chosen lottery trials.
